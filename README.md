# FACE-DETECTION
FACE DETECTION using haarcascades OpenCV

### STEPS TO FOLLOW TO CREATE A FACE DETECTION MODEL
##### STEP 1 : Load some pre_trained data on face frontals from opencv (haar cascade algorithm).
##### STEP 2 : Choose an image to detect face in.
##### STEP 3 : Convert to gray scale - As the algorithm defines a face by difference in shade, not by in colour.
##### STEP 4 : Detect Faces - The pre-trained haarcascades algorithm determines the coordinates around the face.
##### STEP 5 : Draw Rectange around face.
##### STEP 6 : Print Coordinates.
##### STEP 7 : Create a loop so it can determine more than one face.
