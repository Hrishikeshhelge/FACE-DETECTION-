# FACE-DETECTION
**FACE DETECTION using haarcascades OpenCV (Using python programming language)**

### STEPS TO FOLLOW TO CREATE A FACE DETECTION MODEL

##### STEP 1 : Load some pre_trained data on face frontals from opencv (haar cascade algorithm).
##### STEP 2 : Choose an image to detect face in.
##### STEP 3 : Convert to gray scale - As the algorithm defines a face by difference in shade, not by in colour.
##### STEP 4 : Detect Faces - The pre-trained haarcascades algorithm determines the coordinates around the face.
##### STEP 5 : Draw Rectange around face.
##### STEP 6 : Print Coordinates.
##### STEP 7 : Create a loop so it can determine more than one face.


### LIBRARY AND ALGORITHM USED

* **OpenCV** : It is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

* **Haar Cascade classifier** : It is based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyze pixels in the image into squares by function. ... Haar cascade classifier is based on the Viola-Jones detection algorithm which is trained in given some input faces and non-faces and training a classifier that identifies a face.
